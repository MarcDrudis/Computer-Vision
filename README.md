# Computer-Vision
This is the first python project I made. The idea was to get familiar with the language and create something with real life application.

This program creates a canvas from a webcam.
If you want to use this app follow this steps:

1-Have App.py and projfunctions.py in the same directory and run App.py
2-If all the libraries are correctly intalled you will see a window with your webcam's output.
3-Place your webcam onto a flat surface pointing downwards. (See pdf for more explanation).
4-Using right and left click on the mouse you can move the left and right blue dots respectively. They are the delimiters of your canvas (see pdf for pictures).
5-Adjust the sliders if your pointer (could be your finger or a pencil)  is not detected correctly.
6-Once you get accurate detection of the tip of your pointer start the calibration process.
  4 points in the corners and one in the center should be enough, but this might depend on your setup.
7-Hit the restart button and start drawing.
8-If you experience any issues or don't want to go through the process I recommend reading the pdf where I state the most interesting results.
